# Virtual_Secretome_with_Outcyte

Predict secreted proteins of cells by using expressed genes,for which peptide-sequences are retrieved.
Outcyte is then using the peptide sequences to predict (based on N-terminal and other characteristics of the sequence) 
what type of secretion might the cell give :  intracellular, transmembreane, conventional=signal-peptide or unconventional = UPS.
